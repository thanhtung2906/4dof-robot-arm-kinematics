# 4dof-robot-arm-kinematics
Implementation of Forward and Inverse Kinematics to control a 4-DOF robotic arm, featuring both simulation and real-time motion control. Developed using Python for kinematics algorithms and C++ for microcontroller communication.

## Introduction 
This project represents my first step into robotic control algorithms. All algorithms in this project are implemented from scratch to make them clear and easy to understand. It also serves as a foundation for exploring more advanced and complex algorithms in robotics in the future.

## Features
- Forward Kinematics for position estimation
- Inverse Kinematics for trajectory planning
- Real-time control with microcontroller integration (C++)
- Simulation environment in Python
